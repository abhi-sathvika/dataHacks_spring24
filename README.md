In our Vegetarian (T)era: 
## Exploring Vegetarianism in Dinosaurs and Humans

### By: The Tera-dactyls

We were interested in exploring the relationship between vegetarianism/herbivorism in humans versus dinosaurs. Specifically, ***are there connections between the location and the proportion of vegetarianism in the respective populations*** especially since the difference in time periods is drastic? This would help us understand dietary evolution.
